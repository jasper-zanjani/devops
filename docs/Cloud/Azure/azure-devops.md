    Git force-push is specifically disabled for the main branch by default.
    This setting can only be changed by [setting branch permissions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/branch-permissions?view=azure-devops) that take effect for the main branch across the entire organization.
