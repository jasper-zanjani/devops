    [**SageMaker**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/whatis.html) is a service that enables data scientists and developers to quickly and easily build, train, and deploy ML models.

    Exploratory data analysis is facilitated by the ability to quickly create hosted Jupyter notebook instances which are preloaded with popular Python frameworks and libraries. Using **pip install** additional packages can be added to the notebook instance.

    SageMaker facilitates running training jobs by provisioning and tearing down EC2 clusters.

    One or more models can be deployed to an **inference endpoint** hosted on SageMaker.
