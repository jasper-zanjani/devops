# S3

**Simple Storage Service** (S3) was launched in 2006 and one of the first AWS services offered.

S3 objects are stored in logical containers called **buckets**, all of which exist in a single global namespace.
but any created bucket is created in a specified region.

```sh title="S3 bucket URLs"
https://$BUCKET.s3.$REGION.amazonaws.com/
```

Bucket policies apply to the entire bucket.
Object ACLs are specific to the object.

#### Storage classes

-   [**S3 Standard**](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/#General_purpose) (2.3&cent/GB/mo for first 50 TB)<br/>
    Data that is regularly accessed by cloud-hosted applications.
    The first 50 TB is charged at

-   [**S3 Standard-IA**](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/#Infrequent_access) (Infrequent Access) (1.25&cent;/GB/mo)<br/>
    Data that is less frequently accessed, offered at a cheaper rate than Standard.

-   [**S3 One Zone-IA**](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/#__)<br/>
    Provides less durability than Standard-IA because it is stored in a single AZ instead of across 3 AZs, offered at price 20% less than Standard IA.

**Glacier** is a cheap storage option for long-term archival storage.
Costs are incurred per access.
In the context of Glacier, objects are referred to as **archives**.

-   **Glacier Instant Retrieval** (0.4&cent;/GB/mo)<br/>
    Long-term data archiving with millisecond retrieval, 
    Intended for long-lived data that is accessed once per quarter.

-   **Glacier Flexible Retrieval** (0.36&cent;/GB/mo)<br/>
    Retrieve large sets of data at no cost, i.e. backup or DR, but with no instant retrieval.
    Retrieval can take minutes to hours.

-   **Glacier Deep Archive** (0.099&cent;/GB/mo)<br/>
    Data storage on timescales of 7-10 years or longer to meet regulatory compliance requirements.
    Retrieval time 12-48 hours.
    Intended to be accessed less than once a year.
    0.099&cent;/GB/mo.

#### Lifecycle management

S3 Lifecycle configuration defines rules to objects to ensure they are stored economically throughout their lifecycle by transitioning them to cheaper storage classes with age.
Lifecycle rules, which are applied to the bucket, are based on object creation date and are most useful for logs, i.e. S3 buckets with Server Access Logging which can accumulate large log files in another bucket.

Lifecycle actions include:

- **Transition actions** which define when objects transition to another storage class.
- **Expiration actions** which define when objects are to be [expired](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/lifecycle-expire-general-considerations.html) and deleted automatically.

#### Object locks

**S3 Object Lock** implements the **write once, read many (WORM)** model, preventing objects from being deleted or modified.

There are two ways to manage object retention, one or both of which may be used on any object version:

- **Retention period**: A retention period defines a fixed amount of time for protecting an object version and can be applied on individual objects or the entire bucket.

- **Legal Hold**: A legal hold is a different type of object lock that remains in effect until it's removed and has no expiration date.

Object Lock offers two retention modes:

- In **governance mode**, users require special permissions (s3:BypassGovernanceRetention as well as the x-amz-bypass-governance-retention:true as a request header on any API call) to overwrite or delete an object version or alter lock settings. 

- In **compliance mode**, a protected object version can't be overwritten or deleted even by the root user.


**S3 Glacier Vault Lock** allows compliance controls to be deployed for individual vaults with a vault lock policy.

#### Encryption

Types of encryption:

- Encryption in Transit
    - SSL/TL
    - HTTPS
- Encryption at Rest: server-side encryption (SSE)
    - SSE-S3: S3-managed keys, using AES 256-bit encryption
    - SSE-KMS: [AWS Key Management Service](#kms)-managed keys
    - SSE-C: Customer-provided keys
- Encryption at Rest: client-side encryption
    - Encryption of files before upload to S3

#### Replication
   
**S3 Replication** can be used to backup data from one bucket to another, across regions or within the same region.
Versioning must be enabled on both buckets, but delete markers are not replicated by default.
Existing objects are not replicated automatically, but all subsequent updates to objects will be replicated.

## Tasks

#### Create a public bucket

--8<-- "includes/Tasks/aws/aws-s3-public-bucket.md"

#### S3 static website

--8<-- "includes/Tasks/aws/aws-s3-static-site.md"

#### S3 versioning

--8<-- "includes/Tasks/aws/aws-s3-versioning.md"

#### Delete bucket

A bucket must be emptied of all contents before it can be deleted.

```sh
# --force deletes all objects in the bucket
aws s3 rb $BUCKET --force # (1)
```

1. Using the s3api subcommand, the bucket must first be emptied of all objects.
```sh
aws s3api delete-objects --bucket $BUCKET

aws s3api delete-bucket --bucket $BUCKET
```
